title: 2. Advanced Navigation Testing Framework
---

**Task description**

The ROS 2 Navigation Stack has had a focus on testing and reliability as a characteristic change from ROS 1 to ROS 2. We currently have a test coverage rate of 85% and do full system simulations in Continuous Integration (CI) to test the entire navigation system with a real robot completing real navigation tasks. Your task will be to increase the testing coverage rate to 90% (or +5% from your starting) and improve on the existing system tests to represent a more realistic environment. You will then work to make sure of that environment to actively block the robot from completing its task to simulate worst-case conditions.

> ROS 2 导航堆栈的重点是测试和可靠性，这是从 ROS 1 到 ROS 2 的一个特性变化。我们目前的测试覆盖率为 85%，并在连续集成（CI）中进行全系统模拟，以测试整个导航系统，让真正的机器人完成真正的导航任务。您的任务将是将测试覆盖率提高到 90%（或从您开始的+5%），并改进现有的系统测试，以代表更现实的环境。然后，你将努力确保该环境能够主动阻止机器人完成任务，以模拟最坏的情况。

**Project difficulty: Medium**

**Project output requirements**

- Test line coverage of 90% or higher on the repository as reported by codecov (currently 85%)
- An improved simulation environment for a more realistic mobile robotics application
- Updated system tests to take advantage of that environment to fault or un-ideal cases of the stack
